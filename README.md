# odin-landing-page-project

For this project, I created a webpage making extensive use of the flexbox layout.

Live preview: https://greytearsdev.github.io/odin-landing-page-project/

I was unable to prevent both the header and section two from overflowing when the screen gets smaller. Besides that, the stylesheet ended up more messy than expected.

However, I am quite happy with the overall look of the page. I am sure that, if I keep pushing, I'll get the knowledge I need to properly deal with my current challenges.
